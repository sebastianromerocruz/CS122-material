### _Class Information_

- **Pre-Requisites**: CS 121, with a minimum grade of C.
- **Credits**: 4.

### _Description_

This course covers the fundamental concepts and methods of Object-Oriented problem-solving using Java as the programming
language.

The main topics include Java packages, abstract classes and interfaces, class inheritance and polymorphism, recursion 
and linked lists, object modeling with UML, event-driven programming, and basic GUI design with Java FX, multi-threading 
and thread synchronization, and problem-solving through course assignments and a substantial project.

### _Objectives_

1. Use class inheritance and method overriding/overloading to reuse existing classes.
2. Use abstract classes and Java interfaces to specify methods that must be implemented in the derived classes.
3. Understand the dynamic binding of method invocation to the method implementations based on polymorphism.
4. Implement singly linked lists and methods to manipulate such lists.
5. Use type vector and list of the Java collections framework in problem-solving.
6. Understand the concept of program runtime execution stack, method activation record, space allocation, and the 
concept of recursion, and write simple recursive methods to manipulate arrays and linked lists.
7. Understand the basic UML diagram types for modeling objects. 
8. Understand the concepts and basic mechanisms for event-driven programming, and implement basic graphic user 
9. interfaces with JavaFX.
10. Understand the Java mechanism for forking multiple concurrent threads, and use thread synchronization to
    resolve the critical region problem.
11. Have the basic skills in requirement analysis, software design and implementation, and debugging.

### _University Policies and Resources_

#### Academic Integrity

Students in this course are required to adhere to Pace University's Academic Integrity Code. The Academic Integrity Code
supports honesty and ethical conduct in the educational process. It educates students about what constitutes academic
misconduct, helps to deter cheating and plagiarism, and provides a procedure for handling cases of academic misconduct.
Students are expected to be familiar with the Code, which can be found under "University Policies" in the [**student
handbook**](https://www.pace.edu/student-handbook). Individual schools and programs may have additional standards of
academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the policies of the schools, programs,
and courses in which they are enrolled.

Instructions for faculty, a paper about best practices, and the form for reporting integrity policy violations are
posted on the [**Provost's webpage under policies and
forms**](https://www.pace.edu/provost/academic-policies-and-forms). Reporting forms should be sent to the Chairs of the
Academic Conduct Committee on each campus.

#### Learning Centers

[**The Learning Center**](https://www.pace.edu/learning-commons/current-students) uses an array of programs and a
holistic approach to assist students with academic skills and content knowledge. We are dedicated to developing
independent learners by creating purposeful interactions with trained, well-qualified peer and professional staff.

#### Technological Resources

- [**Pace Information Technology Services**](https://www.pace.edu/its)
- For assistance with a technological concern (Blackboard, Internet, Computer, etc.), contact the Pace Helpdesk at
  **914-773-3648** or create a help desk ticket.
- [**Learning Remotely website**](https://www.pace.edu/its/its-service-areas/all-services/working-remotely)

### _Appropriate Use Policy for Information Technology_

Pace endorses the following statement on software and intellectual rights distributed by EDUCAUSE, the non-profit
consortium of colleges and universities, committed to the use and management of information technology in higher
education. The statement reads:

> Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital to academic discourse and enterprise. This principle applies to
> work of all authors and publishers in all media. It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledgment, right to
> privacy and right to determine the form, manner and terms of publication and distribution.
>
> Because electronic information is volatile and easily reproduced, respect for the work and personal expression of
> others is especially critical in computer environments. Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism,
> invasion of privacy, unauthorized access and trade secret and copyright violations, may be grounds for sanctions
> against members of the academic community.

Pace’s appropriate use policy applies to recordings of classroom instruction and digital artifacts created by faculty
and students.

### _Procedure for Students with Disabilities Who Wish to Obtain Reasonable Accommodations for a Course_

The University's commitment to equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities includes providing
reasonable accommodations for the needs of students with disabilities.

To request reasonable accommodation for a
qualified disability a student with a disability must self-identify and register with Student Accessibility Services for
his or her campus. No one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need for or grant a request for
accommodation except Student Accessibility Services. Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact
Student Accessibility Services on behalf of a student. For further information, please see [**Resources for Students
with Disabilities page**](https://www.pace.edu/counseling/student-accessibility-services).

### _Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure_

Pace University is committed to providing a safe environment for every member of its community and to ensuring that no
student, faculty or staff member is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of any University program or
activity on the basis of sex. Accordingly, the University prohibits the following forms of Sex-Based Misconduct: sexual
assault, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual exploitation and
stalking.

You should be aware I am a non-confidential resource and have an obligation to report any information about sexual
assault with the University’s Title IX/Affirmative Action Officer, Ms. Lisa Miles (163 Williams Street, Room 1017,
212-346-1310, [**amiles@pace.edu**](mailto:amiles@pace.edu)). The Title IX/Affirmative Action Office is responsible for
investigating violations of the sexual misconduct policy. For more information about the Pace University sexual
misconduct policy, see the [**Sex-Based Misconduct Policy and Procedure
(PDF)**](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/security-emergency-management/fire-safety-security-report/sex-based-and-non-sex-based-misconduct-policy.pdf).

Members of the University community who believe that they have been subjected to Sex-Based Misconduct are encouraged to
report such incidents to the University and, where applicable, to local law enforcement. **Confidential** resources
include the **University Counseling Centers, Offices of Sexual and Interpersonal Wellness** and **University
Healthcare**. Contact information for those offices may be found in the self-care section below.

### _Self-Care_

Your academic success in this course and throughout your college career depends heavily on your personal health and
well-being. Stress is a common part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected life changes
outside the classroom. The Pace Community strongly encourages you to take care of yourself throughout the term, before
the demands of midterms and finals reach their peak. Please feel free to talk with me about any difficulty you may be
having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. Please
know there are a number of other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you. I strongly encourage you to
contact them when needed.
